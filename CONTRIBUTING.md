# How to contribute to this project
Interested in contributing? This guide will go through how to do just that.

## Reporting bugs
Bug reports are super useful. While I strive to avoid any major issues with my projects, bugs will always slip through the cracks. To make sure the bug can be delt with quickly, please provide as much information on the issue as you can in your report. You can report bugs in 2 ways:
- Adding an issue to this repo
- Submitting a bug report on my website: https://carter.games/report/

I do aim to fix bugs as soon I get reports, but if I cannot replicate the issue or see the issues as a design choice it may be ignored. If you see another public issue on the repo about your issue do not make another issue. Just comment on that issue instead. 


## Pull requests
Your code will have to be reviewed before being applied to the project.

If you have changes you want to merge in there are several things to do to make sure your changes pass.

- Make sure your changes go off the latest release branch, not main! Pull requests to main will be rejected instantly for safety.
- Make sure each commit is concise and explains well what it is changing, with reasoning if needed.
- Make sure your code follows the Carter Games convention: https://carter.games/unity-c-style-guide/.
- Make sure your changes are compatible with the previous version of the asset without breaking anything for the user.
- If adding a new feature, explain in detail what it does and its use case (new features will take longer to review, naturally).
